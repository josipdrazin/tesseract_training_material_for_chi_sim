# tesseract_training_material_for_chi_sim

The directories inside 't2i' directory contain tif images of 100 simplified Chinese characters per directory in 55 different fonts (with some additional text from stdout which I couldn't get rid of) generated by text2image. Each directory contains different set of 100 characters.

The images can be used to create .box files with command:


tesseract -l chi_sim Input/Tiff/Image.tif Output/Box/File batch.nochop makebox

Although it will not omit the stdout information written onto the image by text2image from box file even if you chop or crop or shave that part off from the image by

mogrify -path Output/Box/File  -gravity North -chop 0x130 Input/Tiff/Image.tif

but I think it's safe to delete that part from the box file while editing it.
Chinese characters were fetched from 
https://github.com/CNurt/Chinese-character-lists
and sorted into a training file after checking compatibility with fonts.

Hope someone finds this useful even though it's very messy.
